<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iam Grandmother <u>of Auckland</u>, swear I am the one who filed this petition before Auckland Family Court. Auckland Family Court</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I'd like to update the Court on my position regarding my granddaughter's trip in New Zealand to have an S133 report completed once all COVID19 restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not in a financially able position to take time off work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In saying that I could be able to fly her over for a night of Sunday and return on Monday afternoon. But the cost associated with flights and the cost of a hotel room for the night is the main issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If I can make arrangements for this I'd be pleased for her mother visit and see her daughter where we are staying, before flying back form New Zealand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My financial situation is pretty basic with me. Besides having everything we require however, I do not have luxurious things like flights or other travel. The expense of legal fees and all these regular expenses eats into my. The child's father has given me money to help out and does so when they can. Other than her fathers contribution I have had no form of assistance to help with the cost of raising a 12-year old child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also want to highlight the following instances, on my grand daughters birthday she celebrated her twelfth. She had an amazing day, despite constraints due to restrictions that were that were in the place. We had dinner with her father by skype at her father's preference, followed by cake and a party so to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After talking with her mother she came out to the kitchen, all agitated and clearly upset. She proceeded to explain the reason being that he mom had ruin her birthday with a scathing comment when she showed them photos of the gifts she received. The most notable was that they were all second-hand (which it was not) and the fact that it was all a bargain and there was nothing of significant value there. The child also claimed that when she inquired what they bought her (as they kept referring to this) they said that with the cash they gave her in February when they left was a birthday present for her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her mother then proceeded to tell her we had stolen her money to buy her presents which upset her even more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These sorts of phone calls occur on a regular basis and while most of the time , the child is able to handle it and steer the conversation a different direction there are times when she's been unable to handle the situation, which led to she hung up on her mother and blocking her or the child from being able to suffer physical illness due to the stress that the conversation caused. One of the times she turned off her camera so they couldn't see her and suffered at risk of being bullied by her mother regarding her physical appearance (a flaw or beauty mark it has on her skin).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The child is also extremely upset when her mother say terrible things about me. She is especially upset about what they say about my other parent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most recent incident was last week, when her mother was sick, she was being pressured to her by the maternal grandparents that it was her fault that she wasn't there, and that she was supposed to be taking care of her mother. Also, they were yelling at her about how she needs to inform the court that she wants to go back her home in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also would like to be to be noted that the lawyer for children hasn't yet reached out to her since November 2019 , which is the only interaction she's had.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've gone above and beyond my ways to make it simpler to locate a place that she can speak to the child from a neutral place using skype or zoom. Since having found a solution I have not heard back from her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel like she has felt let down in the respect that she has not had an advocate to represent her and speak up for her needs said.</p>
